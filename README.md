# Selenium Cucumber Test Automation Framework

## Overview

This project is a test automation framework built using Selenium WebDriver and Cucumber for behavior-driven development (BDD) testing. It provides a structured approach to automate web application testing and generate comprehensive test reports using Cucumber and Allure.

## Features

* **Modular Architecture:** Utilizes a modular architecture for easy maintenance and scalability.
* **BDD Testing:** Implements behavior-driven development (BDD) testing using Cucumber for writing feature files and step definitions in plain English.
* **Cross-Browser Testing:** Supports cross-browser testing by leveraging WebDriver for interacting with different web browsers.
* **Test Reporting:** Generates detailed and visually appealing test reports using Allure, providing insights into test execution and results.
* **Reusable Components:** Encapsulates browser management and common functionalities in reusable utility classes for code reusability.
* **Hooks:** Utilizes Cucumber hooks (@Before and @After) for setup and teardown actions before and after test scenarios.


## Setup

### **Prerequisites**

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
* Maven
* WebDriver executable (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome)


## Installation
Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/selenium-cucumber-framework.git

Navigate to the project directory:

    cd selenium-cucumber-framework

Install dependencies:

    mvn clean install

Download and place WebDriver executable in the project directory or update WebDriverManager configuration accordingly.

## Usage

1. Write feature files under src/test/java/features directory using Gherkin syntax.
2. Implement step definitions in corresponding packages under src/test/java/stepDefinition.
3. Execute tests using the TestRunner class or using Maven commands:
    mvn test
4. View test reports generated by Allure:

allure serve target/allure-results
